1. Along with the increase in internet facilities and Mobile phones, exchanging of information is in huge scale. 
2. One of the major data exchanging sources is web applications. Handling of this huge data with existing machine learning methodologies reduce the time complexity and makes it cost effective compared with conventional methods.
3. **Web news documents are classified into different categories like business, entertainment, marketing and technology.**
4. First of all the news document undergoes some text pre-processing using "**NLP**" to reduce noise and computation cost.
5. Applied the feature selection onto the document to further separate important words and less important words inside the document.
6. After applying feature selection the document is classified by the classifier. Then comparison between ML algorithms like **SVM, KNN and LSTM** is done in which LSTM outperformed with 97% accuracy.
